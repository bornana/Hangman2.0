			      CUSTOM CHARACTERS
    =====================================================================


INTRODUCTION 

    In Icy Tower 1.3 you can make your own characters, complete with their
    own sound effects and background music. It's not altogether easy, but 
    if you set your mind to it, you will succeed. 


HOW TO ADD A FINISHED CHARACTER

    This is the easy part. If you have downloaded a new character or 
    received one from a friend, here's how to install it: 
    
    Simply copy the directory holding the new character into the 
    characters/ directory and you're done! The directory tree should look 
    like this when you're done:
    
    	icytower/
    		characters/
    			harold_the_homeboy/
    				files...
    			disco_dave/
    				files...
    			new_character/
    				files...
    				
    (new_character is the directory of your new character (ie. it is named
    what ever the character is named)).
    
    If you managed to install the new character correctly, it will now show 
    up under GAME OPTIONS in the game.
    

HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN CHARACTER

    To make your own character you need three things. Frames (images of
    the moves that the character can do), sounds (what the character can
    say (and music)) and finally a script that tells the game what is what.
    
    The sounds and music are optional, and does not have to be created.


CUSTOM CHARACTER CREATION GUIDE

    Start by coming up with an idea for your character. It might take some
    time to come up with a good one, but that's how it is. The whole process
    will be a lot easier if you have planned what to do before hand.
    
    Now, first make a copy of the directory named 'template', but call it 
    the name of your character instead. Enter the directory and rename the 
    file 'template.txt' to whatever you called your character.
    
    Example: if you renamed the directory to 'jolly_joe', the new name of 
    the text file should be 'jolly_joe.txt'. This is very important, if 
    the directory and the text file don't have the same names, it wont 
    work. (Make sure you can see the file extensions on the files, or 
    you might do something wrong.)
    

CHARACTER GRAPHICS
    
    Let's start with the graphics. First off, since the graphics in Icy 
    Tower is palette based, you need a paint program that can handle 
    palettes. Not all programs can handle palettes, but here's a list
    of a few programs that can:
    
    	Graphics Gale
    	ProMotion (from Cosmigo)
    	NeoPaint
    	Autodesk Animator
    	
    Once you have started your paint program, locate the directory you 
    created above and open the 'template.pcx' (or .bmp) file that is in 
    there.
    
    You will see 15 frames containing outlines of Harold. Below each
    frame is a short description. Here's a more informative description
    of the frames:
    
  	IDLE1 - 3	These frames are the animation that Harold 
  			performs when the player isn't moving him. 
  			The sequence for one cycle is 1-2-1-3. Then it 
  			restarts.
  				
  	WALK1 - 3	This is Harold's walk animation. You have three
  			frames to play with, they will be flipped in 
  			the game when Harold changes direction.
  				
  	JUMP1 - 3	These are the frames used when Harold makes a 
  			medium jump. They show his way up, hanging in 
  			air and down. They will also be flipped if needed.
  			
  	JUMP		The frame for the normal straight up jump.
  	
  	CHOCK		The frame shown when Harold is close to scroll 
  			off the screen.
  			
  	ROTATE		The frame used for Harold's cartwheel jump.
  	
  	EDGE1 - 2	The animation Harold performs when standing on 
  			an edge.
  	
  	
    There you go, now you know how the frames will be used. Start 
    overdrawing the frames of Harold with your own character. Don't forget 
    to save!
    
    A note on using a palette based program. You cannot use just any colors, 
    you only have 256 color to your disposal and half of them are already 
    used by the game. Open up a view of the palette, you will see a large
    chunk of cyan colors (color 144 - 223). These are unused and I suggest 
    you use them for your character. (Ie you can change them into any color
    without affecting the game.
    
    Be warned! If you change a color outside the cyan chunk, it will affect 
    the game. If you know what you're doing you can create special 
    environments for your character, but if you don't you will mess up the 
    game. Caution is advised!
    
    Finally, save your character as either bmp or pcx in the directory you
    created. Make sure you save in 256 color (8bpp).
    

CHARACTER SOUNDS

    This is not so hard as the graphics. Icy Tower characters use simple
    wav-type samples. You'll need eight for full customisation, but you 
    can skip those you don't want.
    
    Here's a list of the sounds you can make.
    
    	greeting	played at the beginning of a new game
    	jumplo		played at a small jump
    	jumpmed		played at a medium jump
    	jumphi		played at a high (cartwheel) jump
    	edge		played when standing on an edge
    	death		played when the character falls off screen
    	pause		played when the game is paused
    	bgmusic		played as background music (looped)
    	
    Create the sounds using the sound recorder/editor of your choice and
    save them as wav. You can name them whatever you want, but the names
    above are easy to remember. Put them all in the directory of your 
    character.
        

CHARACTER SCRIPT

    Finally you need to create a small text file that describes how the
    resources you have created are to be used.
    
    Open up the text file previously named template.txt. (Now it's named
    'the_name_of_the_character.txt', remember? :)
    
    Most of the information is all ready filled in, but here's how it works.
    The game will look for keywords, and then load whatever that is written
    after the keyword. For instance, the line
    
    	[frames]	harold.pcx
    	
    will tell the game to use the file harold.pcx when it looks for what
    frames to use.
    
    The other keywords are: [jumplo], [jumpmed], [jumphi], [edge],
    [greeting], [death], [pause] and [bgmusic]
    
    A sample script file could look like this:
    
        # graphics
    	[frames] template.pcx
    	
        # sound
    	[jumplo] 		jump_lo.wav  
        [jumpmed] 		jump_mid.wav
    	[jumphi]	 	jump_hi.wav   
        [pause] 	 	wazup.wav
    	[death]			falling.wav   
        [greeting]		yo.wav   
    	[edge]			edge.wav
        [bgmusic]		bg_menu.wav
    	
    As you see, [frames] is the only keyword that has to do with
    graphics, all the others has to do with sound. See the section above
    on which sound that is played where.
    
    After each sound keyword, the name of the sound that should be played
    should be written.
    
    
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

    Now you should have a created a directory named 'my_character' (or
    whatever you called it) in the characters directory. In it there 
    should be an image with the frames, the sounds you want to use and
    a text file with the same name as the directory (plus .txt).
    
    If you think you're all set to go, start up Icy Tower and select 
    your character from the game options. If something is wrong with it, 
    you will get messages during start up. Good luck!
    
    (If it doesn't work as planned, check the file log.txt that is 
    created when you run Icy Tower, you might find clues there.)
    

HAVING TROUBLES?
